1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,720
Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
How's the Rock?

3
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,080
Full of mice.

4
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,040
-It's only for a few weeks.
-And it's freezing.

5
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
How's Professor Lehmann?

6
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,120
Good mood, bad mood?

7
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,200
-Depends who she's talking to.
-Probably better that it's not me, then.

8
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,520
Which is why I'm calling, not her.

9
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,520
So what's up?

10
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,600
She just revised the section
of the seabed she wants mapped.

11
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,120
-I'll send you the new specs.
-Okay.

12
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
What?

13
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,840
She wants readings with the AUV
running at 25 meters above the seafloor,

14
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,680
before it runs at ten.

15
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,880
Rahim, that's hundreds of kilometers.

16
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,800
-I know.
-I'll be stuck here all summer!

17
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
-I know.
-Why do I have to start at 25 meters?

18
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,640
So you don't run the AUV aground.

19
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,680
-Like you did...
-Last time, I know.

20
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
So no short-cuts, okay?

21
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,440
Charlie!

22
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
-We missed you last night!
-Last night?

23
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,480
I have a very sloppy text from you
at five this morning.

24
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,400
Did you even go to bed?

25
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,360
I can sleep on the flight.

26
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,840
-Anything you need?
-Where do I start?

27
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,160
If you think of anything, let me know.

28
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,720
Something strange is happening,
I've got to go.

29
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,320
Okay.

30
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,600
Shit.

31
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
Best we can figure, it washed up
on the beach an hour ago.

32
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,520
Came in with the high tide.

33
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,120
A dog walker spotted it.

34
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,880
Said it was already dead.

35
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
He.

36
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,120
-What?
-He's a male.

37
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,560
Was part of a pod that migrated
to Vancouver Island every year.

38
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
Haven't seen him since last season.

39
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
Wind direction is north, north-westerly.

40
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,800
He's not been dead
much more than two, maybe three hours.

41
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,120
-So that would put him about...
-Murray Cove.

42
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,320
Let's see what they have to say.

43
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Can you cordon this off? Someone from
the Institute will be down to cover him.

44
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,960
You think they're bite marks?

45
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,440
What's gonna bite an orca?

46
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
-Leon.
-How are you, Kit?

47
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,760
-Jack.
-Kit.

48
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,120
-It's been a while.
-Too long.

49
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,320
Kit, did you hear anything
about the orca

50
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,440
that washed up on the beach
this morning?

51
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,080
Finish up for me,
I'll be back in a minute.

52
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah.

53
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,360
I'll show you something.

54
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,080
You're saying an orca did this?

55
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,520
I spoke to the guys.
It happened early hours this morning.

56
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,240
Swam close to the boat a couple times.

57
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
They thought it was just being curious
until it started to get aggressive.

58
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,840
They tried to push it aside,
but it just kept coming,

59
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,280
smashing into the side of the boat,
acting all crazy.

60
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
A whale that big, in a boat this size?

61
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,640
They had no choice but to fight back
with billhooks, blades.

62
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,280
-Anything that came to hand.
-No choice?

63
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,280
Do you really think
they'd fight an orca for a few fish?

64
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Catches are dropping off.

65
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,680
Put an animal between a man
and the object of his attention

66
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,040
and you'd be surprised what he'll do.

67
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,720
Nobody around here
would want to see an orca hurt.

68
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,960
If the guys say it attacked,

69
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,240
then it did.

70
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I gotta get back.

71
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
-I'll see you around, Leon.
-See you around.

72
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,960
Charlie!

73
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Welcome to the Rock.

74
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,040
-How long can you stay?
-We can't.

75
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,160
We have to get to the Juno
and the chopper back to base by tonight.

76
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,280
Can you guys give me a hand here?

77
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,240
Nice to see you too, Tomas.

78
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,920
-What happened?
-No idea.

79
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,200
It lost propulsion.
I picked it up and brought it back.

80
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,680
The insulation looks like it's melted.

81
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
-You checked it before you launched it?
-Of course I checked it.

82
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,920
There were no frayed or loose wires?

83
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,000
I know how to run a pre-launch check
on an AUV, Tomas.

84
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,080
Then how do you explain this?

85
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,760
I can't.
I told you, it just lost propulsion.

86
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,920
Are you sure you didn't cause it?

87
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,560
-What's he saying?
-I'm saying she's covering her ass.

88
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,400
-Just leave the parts, okay? I'll do it.
-I'll do it, yeah?

89
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,120
If you burn out another one,
it's my ass on the line.

90
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,760
So when do you sail?

91
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,160
Tomorrow, from Húsavík.

92
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,120
It'll be good to get out of the lab.
Spend some time in the field.

93
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,640
It'll be great.

94
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,000
I wish you were coming.

95
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
And miss all this?

96
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,760
Work is important, you know.

97
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,280
The data the AUVs collect is important.

98
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,360
But operating them
is a job for a first-year student.

99
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,320
We both know why I'm here.

100
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll do the job, stick to the rules,
and all will be forgiven.

101
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Until next time.

102
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,840
Hi.

103
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,680
-A whiskey.
-We have a lot of that.

104
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,680
Any one in particular?

105
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,120
-A good one.
-Can't go wrong with a MacNally.

106
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,600
Sure.

107
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,280
Make it two, Iona.

108
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,320
So what did you do, then?

109
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,680
Sorry?

110
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,800
The guy here last summer,
up at the station...

111
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,360
Stefan?

112
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,520
-That's the one.
-What about him?

113
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,520
He told me,
back in Germany, he started a fire.

114
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,840
Aye, almost burnt the lab down.

115
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,560
I didn't start a fire,
if that's what you're asking.

116
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,440
So what was it then?

117
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,000
I like doing things my own way.

118
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,280
How does that go down with your bosses?

119
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,160
Faculty advisor.

120
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
Not well.

121
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
So when you're not getting up
their noses, what do you do?

122
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Trying to finish my PhD.

123
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
In...?

124
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
I don't want to bore you.

125
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,480
Try me.

126
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,640
Monitoring tidal fluctuation and other
possible stressors on the ecosystem

127
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,080
like overfishing, water pollution...

128
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,680
Overfishing?

129
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
That's a controversial term around here.

130
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, stocks are
on the edge of collapse.

131
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,880
I'd call that overfishing, wouldn't you?

132
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,280
Or men trying to feed their families.

133
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,040
Not if the fish run out.

134
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
So what do you do?

135
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
I'm a fisherman.

136
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,840
Of course you are.

137
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,280
Douglas McKinnon.

138
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,560
-That's Iona.
-Hi.

139
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,840
Charlie Wagner.

140
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,160
So if you ever want any fresh fish,
I go by the station most mornings.

141
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,640
I don't eat fish.

142
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,560
Of course you don't.

143
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm not usually so abrasive,
not on first meeting, anyway.

144
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,920
Thanks for the warning.

145
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
So, drinks on me?

146
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,800
Iona?

147
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,080
Well, thank you very much.

148
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,360
-You can come again.
-Aye. She can.

149
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Thanks for getting back to me.

150
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,400
No, I'm actually looking at the effect
of seismic surveys on marine animals.

151
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,120
And I read your report on
geological studies and oil exploration.

152
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
Yes, I'm from
the World Oceanographic Commission.

153
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,600
It'd be wonderful
if we could schedule a proper interview.

154
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,440
Well, I'm based in Canada
for another month.

155
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
Yeah, a video call would work.

156
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,640
It's Alicia Delaware.
Yes, like the state.

157
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,440
At "woc.org."

158
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,720
I appreciate it.

159
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
Talk to you then.

160
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,480
I heard about the orca.

161
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,520
First whale of the season,
and it washes up dead.

162
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Yeah.

163
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,160
What do you think is going on?

164
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,200
-They've been late before.
-Not this late.

165
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
I'm sorry, you've kind of
caught me at a bad time.

166
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,040
Okay. Sorry.

167
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
I'll catch you later.

168
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,600
I guess there's a first for everything.

169
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,760
-I usually do the ducking out.
-This must be new for you.

170
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

171
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,520
If you pull the door,
it locks on the inside.

172
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,320
And there's coffee over there
if you want.

173
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,440
Believe it or not,

174
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,800
I was going to invite you to breakfast.

175
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm not a breakfast person.

176
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
Clearly.

177
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,240
I need to launch some equipment, so...

178
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,800
-It won't take long.
-There's a storm blowing in.

179
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,120
-It could be dangerous out there.
-I'll be back in no time.

180
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,200
Is there anything I can say
to persuade you otherwise?

181
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,560
Thought as much.

182
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,080
-What are you doing?
-Coming with you.

183
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,520
-I know what I'm doing.
-Oh, I don't doubt that.

184
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,160
But even I wouldn't
go out there on my own.

185
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,720
-Not even going to shower?
-Would you wait for me?

186
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,920
-No.
-There you go then.

187
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Alright. On three.

188
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,320
One, two, three...

189
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,600
-Okay.
-Good.

190
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,800
Hey, do you see that?

191
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,400
What the hell is that?

192
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,760
Pass me that hook?

193
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Thank you.

194
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,080
Okay.

195
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
Do you have a lighter?

196
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,120
Thank you.

197
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,960
Jeez.

198
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,280
It's methane hydrate.

199
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,200
"Fire ice."

200
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,160
Dead algae sink,

201
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,080
and get buried in the seabed.

202
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,560
When they break apart, they release
methane, which then freezes.

203
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,480
Sometimes pieces break free
and float to the surface.

204
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,480
Looks like a hell of a lot.

205
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
More than just a few pieces.

206
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,760
Nice.

207
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,520
You've got a few minutes,
just setting up the call.

208
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,560
Hi, guys.

209
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,000
Charlie, we got the footage.

210
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,240
I have a very important question
for you:

211
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,360
Who's the dude on the boat?

212
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,880
-His name is Douglas.
-We have a name!

213
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,880
He's a friend, just a friend.

214
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,520
-Now will you all kindly fuck off?
-She's here.

215
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,280
Let's get started.

216
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,160
And this was limited to this spot?

217
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,760
I'm going to go back out
and check a few other areas,

218
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,400
see how widespread it is.

219
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,680
-How deep is the water there?
-About 800 meters.

220
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,000
But I checked the tidal flow,
temperature and water pressure,

221
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,080
and I think the hydrates
would've broken free of the seabed

222
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,200
at a depth of 600 meters.

223
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,880
Put the ADCP
in downward-looking mode on the AUV

224
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,560
to measure the currents.

225
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,880
See if you can confirm the location.

226
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,560
-Will do.
-Send me the data.

227
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,600
Without my having to remind you.

228
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,880
Of course.

229
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,400
Let's schedule another call
for the end of the week.

230
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,400
Jess, Tomas, can you stay on?

231
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,960
-I'll sign off...
-No, no, hold on.

232
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Who's the man on the boat?

233
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,600
He was helping me out.

234
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,520
The seas can get pretty fierce
around here.

235
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,880
Next time, you'll ask me.

236
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,240
In the event of an accident,
there are liability issues,

237
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,880
insurance issues for non-employees.

238
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm sorry, I should have checked.

239
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,920
I've no problem with your
asking for someone's help.

240
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,680
But when you go out again,
I expect everyone on board

241
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,520
to be wearing life jackets.

242
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,000
You know the rules
and I expect you to follow them.

243
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,040
It won't happen again.

244
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,160
Looks like you've come a long way
for nothing.

245
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,760
I was hoping
the whales would stick to my schedule,

246
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,960
but it seems they have other ideas.

247
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,480
So how does an Italian
get named after an American state?

248
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,960
Delaware?

249
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,400
I like to think the state
was named after me.

250
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,480
But you'd have to ask my father,
the American.

251
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,760
He doesn't live in Delaware, does he?

252
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,200
Last I heard, he was in Ohio.

253
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,240
Tell me, how did you end up in Canada?

254
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,440
Dishonorable discharge.

255
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,960
-You were military?
-U.S. Navy.

256
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,480
I was a trainer. Dolphins, mostly.

257
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,960
We used them to clear mines
in the Persian Gulf

258
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,360
and the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

259
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,600
When they were retired
from active service,

260
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,520
they didn't know what to do with them.

261
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,160
They didn't think that
they were fit for the wild,

262
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,200
said they were worried
they wouldn't survive,

263
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,440
so they kept them in captivity.

264
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,360
In pens. Too small to swim.

265
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
Kept alive just to die.

266
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,640
So I freed 'em. Got caught.
Got thrown out of the Navy.

267
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,160
Kicked around for a few years.

268
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,480
But a dishonorable discharge
in your record

269
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,840
doesn't exactly
inspire confidence in people.

270
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,400
Folks up here at the Institute
were a little more sympathetic.

271
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,520
-Lizzie, they're back, whales are back.
-I know!

272
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,880
The reports
are just starting to filter in.

273
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,480
Not just here, there've been sightings
up and down the coast.

274
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,120
Everywhere? At the same time?

275
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,320
Listen, I gotta go.
I wanna be the first boat out there.

276
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,680
Hey. Thank you.

277
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,760
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

278
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,200
Welcome aboard.

279
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,440
-Thanks.
-Hi.

280
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,800
Hey.

281
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,400
Are you ready
to see one of these for real?

282
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,160
There you go.

283
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
Glad we stayed in town.

284
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Despite some protests.

285
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,080
-I'm so excited.
-Me too.

286
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,120
So, are you guys excited?

287
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,840
Hey, glad you made it.

288
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,720
I didn't think I would
get a chance to see them.

289
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,920
You're not the only one.

290
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,840
There are some ponchos
next to the life jackets.

291
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,440
Thanks.

292
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,960
Alright, landlubbers.
Everybody on board.

293
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,800
There are pods of whales
which are residents

294
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,680
to the Vancouver Island area.

295
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,680
However, our most exciting visitors are
the whales that migrated south last year

296
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,520
and are only arriving back just now.

297
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,440
-Do you know what kind of whale this is?
-No.

298
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,120
-Orca.
-Orca.

299
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Do you know that Brian uses this part
to navigate? Like on a ship.

300
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,640
There's a rudder on a ship, and you turn
it like this, and it gives a direction.

301
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,720
That is what this is for.

302
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,680
Well, hello!

303
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,920
Looks like we've got our first visitor!

304
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,320
An adult humpback
can reach fifteen meters

305
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,160
and weigh up to thirty tons.

306
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,320
They're bigger than Godzilla.

307
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,920
-Where is it?
-It's gone.

308
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,680
Lizzie, come in!

309
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,520
-Whoa! Where'd it go?
-Where did it go?

310
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,440
Lady Wexham. This is Zodiac, come in.

311
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,560
Lizzie, do you copy?
This is Zodiac, come in.

312
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Get ready. Here comes another soaking!

313
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
My daughter!

314
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,080
-Where's my daughter?
-This is Zodiac. We need help.

315
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,520
I repeat: We need help now!

316
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,440
Get out of the water!

317
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,360
Alicia!

318
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,760
-Mommy!
-Come on!

319
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Mommy!

320
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,040
Come on!

321
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,640
Grab my hand.

322
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,280
Hurry up!

323
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,640
-Mommy!
-Get on the boat!

324
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,840
-Mommy!
-Get on the boat!

325
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Get up.

326
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,880
-Hey!
-Lizzie!

327
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,480
Please.

328
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,000
Lizzie, come on!

329
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,960
-Lizzie.
-Leon.

330
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,600
Lizzie, no!
